# ‚ö° Sometype

A Zig module that helps dealing with `anytype` parameters. It provides functions for testing whether
a given type was returned by an interface in the standard library, or is a certain kind of builtin.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features

I'm not planning to support any version but the latest stable release and the dev branch.
For now, it's only the dev branch.

## Zig 0.14-dev
